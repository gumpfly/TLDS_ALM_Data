# Introduction

This an ensemble of supporting codes for **An orderly single-trial organization of population dynamics in premotor cortex predicts behavioral variability**, which can be used for a general purpose for neural population analyses on single trials.

**The documentation is still under construction** (This line will be removed as it completed).
